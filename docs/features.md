# Feature reference — Split, Budgets, Goals, Trips, Dashboards

Deep reference for the features outside the core cashflow/wealth engines. Conventions
(server-action pattern, `ApiResponse<T>`, cache tags, encrypted-file storage) live in the
root `AGENTS.md`; projection anchoring and transfer injection are detailed in
[projections-and-reconciliation.md](projections-and-reconciliation.md); bank sync in
[bank-sync.md](bank-sync.md); the mortgage in [mortgage.md](mortgage.md); the overall
system picture in [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## 1. Split groups (shared expense splitting — Splitwise replacement)

### Shared-entity model & access control

A `SplitGroup` is a shared, multi-user entity (like `SharedMortgage`). Storage
(`src/lib/db/split-groups.ts`):

```
data/shared/split-groups/{id}.enc                     # group meta + members + recurrence rules
data/shared/split-groups/{id}/expenses/{YYYY-MM}.enc  # array of that month's rows
data/shared/split-groups/{id}/summary.enc             # SplitGroupSummary (running balances + month index)
data/shared/split-group-members/{userId}.enc          # { groupIds: string[] } reverse index
```

Access control lives in the action layer: `loadGroupForMember` in
`src/lib/actions/split-groups.ts` checks `group.members[].userId` against the session;
`requireOwner` gates `updateSplitGroup`, `deleteSplitGroup`, `addSplitGroupMember`,
`removeSplitGroupMember` (which also refuses while the member's net ≠ 0),
`updateSplitGroupMemberRole` (which also refuses demoting the group's only owner —
promote another member first to transfer ownership), and `importSplitwiseCsv`. Members
are account-only, added by email via `findUserByEmail`; the creator is an `owner`.
`setDefaultSplitGroup` stores `defaultSplitGroupId` in the user's preferences (used by
the quick-add modal).

**Cache tags** (`invalidateGroup`): `split-group:{id}`, `split-group:{id}:summary`,
`split-group:{id}:expenses`, plus each member's `user:{userId}:split-groups` — one
invalidation reaches every member. Cached readers in `src/lib/db/cached.ts`.

### Money model — INTEGER CENTS, Splitwise-compatible signs

All split money is **integer cents** (`toCents`/`fromCents` in
`src/lib/split-utils.ts`; the Zod schemas enforce `z.number().int()`). Every row
(`SplitExpense` in `src/types/index.ts`, a discriminated union of
`kind: 'expense'` → `SplitExpenseItem` and `kind: 'payment'` → `SplitPayment`) carries
`netByUserId` — cents per member, summing to 0 — as the **canonical** balance
contribution: **`net > 0` ⇒ the member is OWED, `net < 0` ⇒ the member OWES.** This is
the same sign convention as the Splitwise CSV export, so imports copy the numbers
directly. A member's running balance = Σ net across rows.

### Pure engine (`src/lib/split-utils.ts`, unit-tested)

- `resolveSplit(memberIds, amountCents, spec)` reduces a `SplitSpec`
  (`paidByUserId` + `splitMode` + optional `splitConfig` / `participantUserIds`) to
  `{ netByUserId, paidBy, owed }`. Single-payer model. Modes:
  - `equal` — even split with the remainder cents handed to the first ids in order
    (deterministic: 10.00 / 3 → 3.34 / 3.33 / 3.33);
  - `full` — payer owes nothing; the other participants split the whole amount;
  - `exact` — `splitConfig` is cents per member and **must sum exactly** to the total
    (throws otherwise);
  - `percent` / `shares` — `splitConfig` values are weights; allocation uses the
    **largest-remainder method** (ties broken by index) so parts sum exactly.
- `paymentNet(from, to, amount)` → `{ [from]: +amount, [to]: -amount }` (a settle-up
  raises the payer's balance).
- `computeMemberBalances(members, rows)` sums `netByUserId` per member.
- `suggestSettleUp(balances)` — greedy debt simplification: largest debtor pays largest
  creditor until all balances zero out (fewest transfers for 2 members; general for n).
- `generateOccurrenceDates(rule, upToInclusive)` — date-grained recurrence
  (`daily | weekly | biweekly | monthly | yearly` from `anchorDate`), resumes exactly
  after `lastGeneratedThrough`, honors `endDate`, hard guard at 10 000 iterations.
- `guessCategory(title)` — keyword lookup (Finnish + English merchant words), fallback
  `'General'`. Used by `quickAddSplitExpense` when no category is given.

### Storage strategy & concurrency

- **Monthly chunks**: one encrypted file holds the array of a month's rows — not one
  file per row (thousands of per-file decrypts per cache miss otherwise). `addExpense`
  (hot path) appends to one chunk and **delta-updates** `summary.enc`
  (`bumpSummaryForAdd`: O(1), no other chunks read; `monthsWithData` is refreshed from
  chunk **filenames**, no decrypt). `updateExpense` (may move a row across chunks),
  `deleteExpense`, `bulkImportExpenses`, and occurrence overwrites call
  `rebuildSummary` (full recompute from all chunks). Empty chunks are deleted.
- `SplitGroupSummary` = `{ netByUserId, expenseCount, paymentCount, lastActivityAt?,
  monthsWithData, updatedAt }` — the hot reads (balances, month index) never decrypt
  history.
- **Per-group in-process mutex**: `withGroupLock(groupId, fn)` in
  `src/lib/actions/split-groups.ts` chains promises per group id, serializing
  read-modify-write of chunks/summary/rule cursors. Correct only because the app is a
  single node (`next start`); there is no on-disk locking anywhere in the codebase.

### Recurrence — materialized, not computed

Unlike the cashflow projection (which expands recurring items on the fly), split
recurrence **writes real rows**. `SplitRecurrenceRule`s are embedded in the group doc
(`addRecurrenceRule` / `updateRecurrenceRule` / `deleteRecurrenceRule`).
`catchUpGroupRecurrences(groupId)`:

- generates one expense per due occurrence with the deterministic
  `occurrenceKey = ${ruleId}:${YYYY-MM-DD}`; `upsertExpenseByOccurrence` overwrites an
  existing occurrence in place (preserving `id`/`createdAt`) so re-runs never duplicate;
- advances each rule's `lastGeneratedThrough` monotonically;
- skips `invalidateGroup` entirely when nothing was generated;
- runs under `withGroupLock`.

It is a **server action**, triggered from client effects — the Home dashboard calls it
for every group on mount (`home-dashboard.tsx` `fetchData`), and
`createSplitRecurrenceRule` calls it immediately (back-dated anchors materialize at
once). It must **not** run from the background bank scheduler: `updateTag` only works in
request scope. Stopping a rule = `isActive: false` or an `endDate`; pausing keeps
already-generated rows.

**End date editing**: `updateSplitRecurrenceRuleSchema` is a partial extended with
`endDate: nullable().optional()` — sending `null` clears it ("Never"). The pure
`planRecurrenceRuleUpdate` (`src/lib/split-utils.ts`) detects whether the request
carries the `endDate` key and, when the effective end moved back past
`lastGeneratedThrough`, returns a `pruneAfter` date: `updateSplitRecurrenceRule` then
deletes the rule's generated occurrences after it (`deleteGeneratedOccurrencesAfter`
in `src/lib/db/split-groups.ts` — chunk rewrite + one summary rebuild, caller holds
the lock) and clamps `lastGeneratedThrough` to the new end. Prune + rule update run
inside **one** `withGroupLock`; `catchUpGroupRecurrences` (re-materializing occurrences
when the end was extended) runs **outside** it — the mutex is non-reentrant, calling it
inside would deadlock. A generated row the user has since edited still carries
`generatedFromRuleId` and is pruned too (accepted edge). The dialog
(`recurrence-rule-dialog.tsx`) has an "Ends" Calendar (placeholder "Never",
`showButtonBar` Clear, min = start date, hint "Shortening the end date removes
generated expenses after it."); the detail page's rule list shows "· until {date}".

### Splitwise CSV import

- `parseCsv` (`src/lib/split-csv.ts`) is a real RFC 4180 parser: quoted commas, `""`
  escapes, CR/LF/CRLF, BOM strip.
- `parseSplitwiseCsv` expects `Date,Description,Category,Cost,Currency,<member…>`
  (member columns are signed net balances summing to ~0), skips blank separator rows and
  the trailing `Total balance` footer, flags `Payment`-category rows, requires a
  non-empty per-row currency and a `YYYY-MM-DD` date, and parses amounts leniently
  (`parseAmountToCents`: `98,90`, `1.234,56`, `1,234.56`, currency symbols, Unicode
  minus). Rows whose member balances don't sum to 0 get a non-fatal warning. A file
  containing more than one currency is rejected outright (fatal error, no rows kept).
- The import dialog (`src/components/split/split-import-dialog.tsx`) auto-maps each
  member column to a group member by fuzzy first-name match and requires every column to
  be mapped. `importSplitwiseCsv` (owner-gated) rejects mappings to non-members, builds
  rows with `source: 'import'` and `buildNetByUserId`; payment rows get payer/payee from
  `paymentParties` (column signs; rows that aren't a clean pairwise transfer are
  skipped), and rejects the import when any row's currency differs from the group's.
  Imported rows are stored with the **group's** currency, and `paidBy`/`owed`
  are left `undefined` — imports only know net, and the ledger displays who *added* a
  row, not who paid. `bulkImportExpenses` writes ~1 file per month (optionally
  `replaceAll`), then rebuilds the summary once.

### Bank-transaction linking

`SplitExpenseItem.bankLink?: SplitExpenseBankLink` is an optional, denormalized
pointer to the bank transaction an expense was created from: `txId`,
`linkedAccountId`, `ownerUserId` (whose bank connection), `bookingDate`, `amount`,
`currency`, and optional `counterpartyName`/`bankName` — denormalized so other
group members can see basic details without access to the owner's bank data, and
deliberately **never carries an IBAN**. It is created by the bank ledger's
"Split this" action or by confirming a detected suggestion. Both paths use
authenticated server validation, which stamps `ownerUserId` and builds the
stored metadata from the owned bank transaction. `updateSplitExpenseSchema`
omits `bankLink` entirely, so ordinary editing can never add, forge, or drop the
link; `updateSplitExpense` carries `existing.bankLink` through its row rebuild
unchanged.

Bank ledger rows show an **"already split" flag** (filled pill = linked, dashed
pill = heuristic) computed by the pure `matchTransactionsToSplits`
(`src/lib/bank-split-match.ts`, unit-tested). Matching runs in three passes:
all exact `bankLink.txId` links first (including every row linked to the same
transaction, exposed as related matches), then strict pending→booked recovery,
then greedy one-to-one heuristic matching. Recovery is a **suggestion** when a
booked row has a new id: it requires the same linked account, currency, signed
cents, a strong non-generic merchant match, and a purchase date within ±3 days;
if the old pending row is still present it must be pending. It remains
unconfirmed until the user chooses to confirm it.

Unlinked heuristic candidates use the same currency, exact cents, and purchase
date within ±3 calendar days, with merchant affinity preferred before distance.
The duplicate warning also considers amounts within the greater of 100 cents
or 2% when merchant identity strongly matches. Candidates come from the read-only action
`getMySplitLinkCandidates(months)`, which validates and deduplicates `YYYY-MM`
inputs, preserves all requested months, pads each with adjacent months (up to
the 36-month cap), and intersects those reads with each group's
`summary.monthsWithData` before opening chunks.

The bank ledger warns before creating a possible duplicate and shows the
existing split title, group, date, and amount. The user can cancel or explicitly
acknowledge the listed expense ids to add another row. The server repeats the
check inside the per-group mutex, so concurrent saves cannot bypass the warning;
the bank link is built from the authenticated user's server-loaded transaction
and canonical date, amount, currency, merchant, and bank name. A dedicated
`confirmSplitBankLink` action verifies ownership and group membership, confirms
an eligible suggestion or pending manual match, preserves the financial split,
and only emits `expense.updated` when a link actually changes.

A single confirmed flag on `/bank` navigates to
`/split/{groupId}?expense={id}&month={YYYY-MM}` (scroll + flash-highlight).
Suggestions open a review dialog with both records and **Confirm link**; multiple
confirmed matches open a list of linked expenses. On the split group detail page,
a `bankLink` marks the row with a small inline bank glyph in the subtitle and adds a
"View bank transaction" item to the row menu: the owner's own transaction navigates to
`/bank?account=…&tx=…`; another member's opens `BankLinkDetailsDialog`
(`src/components/split/bank-link-details-dialog.tsx`), a display-only dialog showing
the member, bank, date, amount, and counterparty.

### Overview fold-in

`getMySplitNetBalance()` sums the logged-in user's net across non-archived groups —
**summaries only**, no chunk reads. The Overview page passes it as
`WealthProjectionData.splitNetTotal` (`src/lib/wealth-projection.ts` adds it flat to net
worth, mirroring the card-liability fold-in) and shows a **"Split balance" KPI** when
non-zero (green when owed, red when owing). It replaces any manually-kept receivable
mirroring Splitwise totals — **such a manual receivable must be deleted** or the amount
is double-counted. Split balances are *not* injected into the cashflow projection.

### UI map

- `/split` (`src/app/(dashboard)/split/page.tsx`, nav "Split") — group list;
  `group-form-dialog.tsx` creates/edits groups. Group cards render in a responsive
  grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`, single column on mobile) with equal-height
  cards; each is a clickable `<Link>` with a hover tint/border affordance. A group
  card shows a "new activity" dot when `summary.lastActivityAt >
  splitLastSeenAt[groupId]` (hidden when the group has no watermark baseline yet)
  and member `<UserAvatar>`s. The page also renders:
  - an **"Across all groups" summary card** — the viewer's aggregated pairwise
    position per counterparty (with avatars), from the pure `aggregatePairwiseNets`
    (`src/lib/split-insights.ts`): it sums each group's `suggestSettleUp` output so it
    always agrees with what each group's settle-up screen would say. Cross-currency
    positions stay separate with a "(mixed currencies)" note. Styled with a muted
    (`bg-gray-50`/`dark:bg-gray-900/40`) surface, distinct from the group cards'
    white/dark-gray cards, so its non-interactive, aggregate nature reads at a glance.
  - an always-expanded **Insights** section — `getSplitInsights(monthsBack = 12)`
    (`src/lib/actions/split-groups.ts`; cached summaries → overlapping months' chunks →
    the pure `computeSplitInsights`) drives two lazy ECharts: `split-spend-chart.tsx`
    (stacked spend, **By member (default) / By category / By group** toggle; tooltips append each
    series' share of the month total as a percentage, and By-member mode also renders
    in-bar `{pct}%` labels — suppressed under 8% or on empty months so thin slices stay
    clean. Category mode buckets the engine's full `spendByCategory` through the pure
    `bucketSpendByCategory(insights, 8)` — top-8 categories by window total plus an
    aggregated 'Other' — and colors each category via `getCategoryColor`, never
    positionally) and `split-net-chart.tsx` (running viewer-net line with a zero
    markLine over green/orange **monthly-change bars**; the first month's bar is
    measured against `insights.viewerNetBaseline` — the position just before the
    window — and when a large standing balance dwarfs the deltas the bars move to a
    hidden second y-axis whose zero is pixel-aligned with the primary axis's zero, so
    they stay readable without lying about their anchor). **Spend**
    counts `kind === 'expense'` rows only. **Paid attribution**: native rows use exact `paidBy` shares; net-only
    **imported rows credit each member `max(0, net)` — a documented LOWER BOUND** (a
    payer who also consumed shows only their net), mirroring the imported-row fallback
    in `buildSplitBudgetEntries`. **Running net** baselines each group just before the
    window (`totalNetByUserId[viewer] − Σ window viewer net`) then accumulates
    month-by-month, summed across groups. Each chart's plain-words description
    (`describeSplitSpend`/`describeSplitNet`, `src/lib/chart-descriptions.ts`) covers the
    whole window AND the current month: "This month so far: €X" (or "No shared expenses
    yet this month"), a typical-month comparison (average over nonzero prior months,
    emitted only at ≥2 of them), a mode-aware "This month, {X} leads instead" when the
    current month's top group/category/payer differs from the window's, and the net
    chart's "This month it moved up/down €X so far".
  - Group cards **reorder via jiggle mode** (the Motion guidance in
    [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#17-shared-ui-implementation-rules)): a long-press
    enters the mode, drag/drop or arrow keys reorder, and the flat id order persists to
    `UserPreferences.splitGroupOrder` (`updateSplitGroupOrder`, sanitized against the
    current group ids). The jiggle-reorder math is strictly one-dimensional (item
    centers from `offsetTop`), so the grid collapses to a single column for the
    duration of jiggle mode and reverts to the 2-up grid once it exits.
- `/split/[id]` — balance banner, a **"Last 30 days" insights card**
  (`src/components/split/group-period-card.tsx`, between the banner and the recurring
  rules; hidden when the group has no expenses): total spend headline and a
  default-**open** `.collapse-grid` expander holding two small **CSS mini-treemaps**
  side by side (1-col on mobile) — "By category" (top 5 + an 'Other' bucket, tiles
  tinted `getCategoryColor`, top-3 legend with amounts) and "Who paid" (tiles tinted
  each member's `getAvatarColor`, avatar/name/%/amount legend) — both laid out by the
  pure slice-and-dice `computeTreemapLayout` (`src/lib/treemap-layout.ts`, unit-tested);
  each treemap is `role="img"` whose label carries names + percentages only (money
  lives in the legends and `title` tooltips). Below them: top-3 single expenses and
  plain-words sentences from `describeGroupPeriod`. Collapsed, the card is just the
  headline + toggle. All math in the pure
  `computeGroupPeriodInsights(members, rows, fromDate, toDate)`
  (`src/lib/split-insights.ts`) over the already-loaded expense chunks — the 30-day
  window spans at most two calendar months, always inside the initial 3-chunk load, so
  the card needs no extra fetch. Payments count only toward `settledCents`; imported
  rows use the same `max(0, net)` lower-bound paid attribution (a caveat note shows
  when any are in-window). Then an **Expenses / Activity** toggle (Activity reuses
  `SplitActivityFeed` with `showGroup={false}`, fetched lazily via
  `getSplitActivity(30, groupId)` — the same action as Home's cross-group feed, now
  taking an optional `groupId`), month-paginated ledger (sticky month headers; older
  months load via **infinite scroll** — an IntersectionObserver sentinel with
  `rootMargin` 300px, re-observed on each reveal + view switch, mirroring
  `bank-ledger-table.tsx`, wraps the kept "Load older months" button as the a11y
  fallback + loading indicator — driven by `summary.monthsWithData`; when the loaded
  window is empty but older months exist the empty state says "Nothing this month"
  with a load-older action instead of "No expenses yet"), recurring rules
  (`recurrence-rule-dialog.tsx`), Settle-up (`settle-up-dialog.tsx`, prefilled from
  `getSettleUpSuggestions`), Import. **Whole rows are `role="button"`**: an expense row
  opens the edit dialog, a payment row opens its row menu, and trailing action buttons
  `stopPropagation`. Each expense row's subtitle reads
  `"{Payer} paid {amount} · added by {Adder}"` with **first names** ('You' for self); a
  `paidBy`-less imported row omits the payer segment. The trailing net indicator is a
**stacked** label-over-amount block ("you lent" / "you borrowed" at `text-xs` above the
`tabular-nums` amount — zero net stays a single "—"); titles are single-line
`truncate text-sm leading-snug` and the only trailing button is the row menu, so the
title keeps most of the row's width on a phone. Rows show member `<UserAvatar>`s,
  and the page applies optimistic UI on delete / rule pause-resume. A row with a
  `bankLink` shows an inline bank glyph in its subtitle + a "View bank transaction" row-menu
item (see "Bank-transaction linking" above); `?expense=&month=`
  deep-links to a row (extends `visibleCount` to reach the month, then scroll +
  flash-highlights it). The **Activity tab** makes its rows clickable through
  `SplitActivityFeed`'s `onEventClick`/`isEventClickable`/`myId` props — an expense event
  opens the edit dialog (fetching that month's chunk if it isn't loaded).
- **Celebrations**: creating a split expense (in-group dialog and the global
  quick-add) fires a ~1.5s checkmark badge-pop (an expanding ring ripple + a 6-dot
  burst, then a 450ms check draw), and a settle-up fires a ~1.5s canvas confetti
  burst, via `useCelebration()`
  (`src/components/providers/celebration-provider.tsx`) — two of the three sanctioned
  exceptions to the ≤250ms motion rule ([architecture.md](architecture.md#17-shared-ui-implementation-rules); the jiggle-mode
  wobble is the third). Under reduced motion `celebrate()` returns `false` and callers
  fall back to the flash-highlight row + toast.
- **New since last visit**: `UserPreferences.splitLastSeenAt?: Record<groupId, ISO>`
  is a per-group watermark written by `markSplitGroupSeen(groupId, seenAt)`
  (`src/lib/actions/split-groups.ts`; membership-checked,
  `markSplitGroupSeenSchema` ISO datetime, future-clamped, monotonic forward-only,
  spread-merged into the record). The detail page snapshots the watermark **at
  mount** (never updated during the visit) and marks rows created after it **by
  other members** with a primary dot (+ sr-only "New"); it persists the watermark
  forward via dwell-marking — `useDwellSeen` (`src/lib/hooks/use-dwell-seen.ts`, IO
  threshold 0.5, ~1.6s continuous dwell) feeds `computeSeenWatermark`
  (`split-utils.ts`, pure): a **contiguous frontier** from the newest row (own rows
  auto-pass; a never-on-screen row is never marked), debounced 2s with an unmount
  flush. A first-ever visit shows no dots and stamps the baseline to now. Accepted
  edges: your own off-page quick-adds self-dot until you open the group, and the
  watermark only considers loaded months.
- **Global quick-add FAB** (mounted in `app-layout.tsx`) opens the
  `entityType: 'split-expense'` drawer → `QuickAddSplitModal`
  (`quick-add-split-modal.tsx`): title + amount is enough — `quickAddSplitExpense`
  defaults to *you paid, split equally, today*, with `guessCategory` and
  "Save & add another". The **amount field is first and autofocused** (the daily-driver
  hot path is "enter a number"); `split-expense-dialog.tsx` mirrors the amount-first
  order and autofocuses amount only when creating. Accepts an optional `bankLink`
  (prefilled by the bank ledger's "Split this"); after a successful save the modal
  fire-and-forget calls `setDefaultSplitGroup` so the next quick-add preselects the
  last-used group.
- **Shared `<SplitEditor>`** (`split-editor.tsx`; logic in `src/lib/split-draft.ts`,
  unit-tested): the single "how to split" UI used by quick-add, group add/edit
  (`split-expense-dialog.tsx`) and recurring dialogs. Presets `me-equal` / `me-full` /
  `other-equal` / `other-full` plus **Custom** (pick payer; split by exact amounts or
  percentages). `resolveDraftSpec` maps the draft to the engine's `exact`/`percent`
  modes; members left blank **auto-absorb the remainder equally** (with two people, one
  entered value fills the other), with errors when entered values exceed the
  total / 100%. `draftFromExpense` / `draftFromSpec` rebuild the editor state for edit
  flows.
- `split-activity-feed.tsx` renders the cross-group feed (see Home, §4);
  `category-icon.tsx` maps categories to icons. Split categories are
  `SPLIT_CATEGORIES` in `src/lib/constants.ts` (mirrors Splitwise's set).

### Home Assistant notifications

Split mutations POST one JSON payload to a Home Assistant webhook, which fans it out
to the recipients' phones (HA owns the delivery policy; Sampolio owns the payload).
Engine: `src/lib/split-notify.ts` — a **plain server module, NOT `'use server'`**
(synchronous exports, and the transport must never become a client-invokable
endpoint). Emitted **post-response** through `after()` from `next/server` — the only
use of that hook in the codebase — so a slow or dead Home Assistant can never fail or
delay a save.

**Configuration.** `getSplitNotifyConfig()` needs `HA_WEBHOOK_URL` (the full webhook
URL, secret id included) **and** `AUTH_URL` (the deep-link base, trailing slash
stripped). Either missing/blank ⇒ null ⇒ the feature is hard-disabled with **zero
network calls**, mirroring `getBankConfig()`. See
[`docs/operations.md`](operations.md) §9.

**Events and their author.**

| Event | Raised by | `author` |
|---|---|---|
| `expense.created` | `createSplitExpense`, `quickAddSplitExpense` | the acting member |
| `expense.updated` | `updateSplitExpense` | the acting member |
| `expense.deleted` | `deleteSplitExpense` | the acting member |
| `payment.recorded` | `recordSettleUp` | the **recorder** (may differ from the payer) |
| `expense.generated` | `catchUpGroupRecurrences` (one per generated row) | the **rule's payer** (matches the row's `createdByUserId`) |

**Recipients and opt-out.** `recipients` = the group's members **minus the author**,
minus anyone who turned that event off. Each entry is `{ id, name, email }` (the
`author` object deliberately carries no email). The per-user opt-out lives in
`UserPreferences.splitNotificationPrefs?: Partial<Record<SplitNotifyEvent, boolean>>`
— **opt-out semantics**: an absent object, an absent key, or `true` all mean
*notify me*; only an explicit `false` disables (`isSplitNotifyEnabled`). No migration
was needed and new event types default to on. Preferences are read with the **plain**
db read (not the `'use cache'` wrapper — `after()` runs outside a reliable cache
scope). UI: Settings → General → **"Push notifications"** (both display modes) with
five toggles — New expenses / Edited expenses / Deleted expenses / Settle-ups /
Recurring expenses. `getSplitNotifyStatus()` tells the panel whether the server is
configured; when it isn't, an info `AlertBanner` says so and the toggles still save.

**Skip rules.** No POST at all when: the feature is unconfigured; `recipients` is
empty (a solo group, or every other member opted out — `buildSplitWebhookPayload`
returns `null`); or a **payment** row is deleted (`deleteSplitExpense` snapshots the
row first and only notifies for `kind === 'expense'`).

**Timeout & redaction.** One `fetch` per event, aborted after **5s**
(`SPLIT_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_MS`). `postSplitWebhook` never rejects: a non-2xx logs
`Split webhook delivery failed ({event}): HTTP {status}`, a throw logs the event plus
the error's `name`. The **webhook URL is never logged** (it embeds the secret webhook
id) and neither is any payload content (names, emails, titles, amounts). Delivery is
best-effort — no retry, no queue, no delivery log.

**Payload contract.** `message` is prebuilt (fi-FI money via `formatCents`) so the HA
automation needs no formatting logic; `url` deep-links to the group.

```jsonc
{
  "event": "expense.created",          // one of the five above
  "ts": "2026-03-04T10:20:30.000Z",   // ISO event timestamp
  "message": "Alex added 'Groceries' — €42,50 in Flatmates",
  "url": "https://money.example.com/split/g1",
  "group":  { "id": "g1", "name": "Flatmates", "emoji": "🏠", "currency": "EUR" },
  "author": { "id": "a1", "name": "Alex" },
  "recipients": [
    { "id": "s1", "name": "Sam", "email": "sam@example.com" },
    { "id": "k1", "name": "Kim", "email": "kim@example.com" }
  ],
  // present for the four expense.* events only
  "expense": {
    "id": "e1", "title": "Groceries", "category": "Food",
    "amountCents": 4250, "currency": "EUR",
    "date": "2026-03-04", "source": "manual"   // 'recurring' for expense.generated
  },
  // present for payment.recorded only
  "payment": { "fromUserId": "s1", "toUserId": "a1", "amountCents": 4250, "currency": "EUR" }
}
```

Message shapes (single quotes around the title, em dash before the amount):

- `expense.created` — `{Author} added '{title}' — {amount} in {group}`
- `expense.updated` — `{Author} updated '{title}' — {amount} in {group}`
- `expense.deleted` — `{Author} deleted '{title}' — {amount} in {group}`
- `expense.generated` — `Recurring expense '{title}' — {amount} added in {group} (paid by {payer})`
- `payment.recorded` — `{Payer} paid {Payee} {amount} in {group}`, plus
  ` (recorded by {Author})` **only** when a third member logged it

An unknown member id renders as `Someone`. The pure builder + opt-out gate +
transport are unit-tested in `src/lib/split-notify.test.ts`.

## 2. Budgets (trip/project budgets with grant funding)

### Storage & access

A `Budget` is user-scoped and stored as **one encrypted document** at
`data/users/{id}/budgets/{id}.enc` with `lines`, `fundingSources`, and `expenseEntries`
embedded (`src/lib/db/budgets.ts`). One read/write per edit, one cache tag
`user:{userId}:budgets`. Actions in `src/lib/actions/budgets.ts` load via
`loadOwnBudget` (session user only).

### Pure engine (`src/lib/budget-utils.ts`)

- `expandBudgetLines` expands one-off lines (their `month`, clamped into the period)
  and monthly lines (their `startMonth…endMonth` range, clamped) into per-month costs.
- `allocateFunding` — deterministic greedy allocation of funding to planned costs:
  **restricted** sources (`restrictedToCategories` non-empty) go first, most
  constrained first (fewest allowed categories, ties by list order); each walks its
  allowed categories by **descending uncovered cost** (ties alphabetical). A restricted
  source's leftover is `unusableSurplus` — it can never pay other categories and is
  never netted against out-of-pocket. Unrestricted sources then fill remaining costs the
  same way; their surplus stays usable. (Deliberately greedy, not max-flow — see the
  function comment.)
- `expandFundingReceipts` — when usable money arrives: `upfront` → first month;
  `monthly` → even split across the period; `specific-month` → that month (clamped).
- `computeFeasibility(budget)` → `{ totalCosts, totalFunding, usableFunding,
  unusableSurplus, outOfPocket, freeSurplus, allocation, perMonth[] }` where
  `outOfPocket = max(0, totalCosts − usableFunding)` and each `BudgetMonthRow` carries
  planned costs, funding received, net, and cumulative net. Computed client-side on the
  budget page and server-side for injection.
- `computeActualsRollup` — planned vs. actual per category and claimed vs. usable per
  funding source, from the expense log. **Entries dated outside the period still
  count** ("real trips bleed at the edges").
- `computeBudgetTransfers(budget)` — the injected lines (below), converted by
  `budget.exchangeRate ?? 1`.

**Per-diem sources** always store `amount = perDiemRate × perDiemDays`
(`calcPerDiemTotal`; recomputed by `withPerDiemAmount` on every save in the actions).

**Trip-funded per-diem sources** (`BudgetFundingSource.linkedTripId?`): a per-diem
funding source can instead draw its amount from a linked `Trip`'s live per-diem total.
The funding schema requires **rate + days XOR `linkedTripId`**, and rejects
`linkedTripId` on any non-per-diem funding type. The stored `amount` is a write-time
snapshot; `hydrateBudgetFundingFromTrips(budget, trips)` (pure, `budget-utils.ts`)
re-derives it from `calculatePerDiem(trip).total` at **read time** in `getBudgets` /
`getBudgetById` and in `getBudgetTransfersForAccount` — a missing/deleted trip leaves
the stored snapshot standing. Linking requires **`budget.currency === 'EUR'`**, and a
trip funds **at most one budget** (`resolveTripLinkedAmount` scans every budget's
funding sources; conflict → a curly-quote "already funds …" error). The funding dialog's
per-diem editor offers a `SelectButton` "From a trip | Manual rate × days"; the trip
options show live per-diem totals, already-linked trips are disabled, and picking one
prefills the source name + `specific-month` timing at the trip's reimbursement month. A
**"New trip" button** in trip mode creates a trip without leaving the budget: it opens
`TripDialog` layered over the funding dialog, prefilled from the budget (name,
`linkedAccountId`, reimbursement month = `budget.endMonth`; `TripDialog` takes an
optional create-only `initial` prop and its `onSaved` passes the created `Trip`
through); on save the funding dialog auto-selects the new trip and refreshes the page's
trips list via `onTripsChanged`. A funding row shows "from trip: {name}" deep-linked to
`/budgets#trips` (amber hint if the trip was deleted), and the `TripCard` shows a
"Funds: {budget}" tag.

**Double-count guard**: a trip whose per-diem already reaches cashflow through a budget
must NOT also inject its own `source: 'trip'` reimbursement income —
`tripIdsFundedByActiveBudgets(budgets)` (confirmed && `!isArchived` && `linkedAccountId`
&& a per-diem source with `linkedTripId`) is subtracted inside
`getTripTransfersForAccount`. A draft or archived budget doesn't suppress the trip
(the money isn't reaching cashflow yet, so the trip keeps injecting). The
`confirmBudget` toast mentions the handoff, and deleting a trip that funds a budget warns.

### Confirm / unconfirm & cashflow injection

`status: 'draft' | 'confirmed'` is changed **only** by `confirmBudget` /
`unconfirmBudget`. `confirmBudget(budgetId, { linkedAccountId, exchangeRate? })`
requires the budget to be unarchived and — when the budget currency differs from the
account currency — a positive `exchangeRate` (`1 budget unit = X account units`).
`unconfirmBudget` reverts to `'draft'` but keeps `linkedAccountId`/`exchangeRate` so
re-confirming is one click. `updateBudget` refuses a currency change that would leave a
confirmed, linked budget without a rate.

`getBudgetTransfersForAccount` (`src/lib/projection-inputs.ts`) selects budgets with
`status === 'confirmed' && !isArchived && linkedAccountId === accountId` and injects up
to **2 aggregated read-only lines per month** (one expense = planned costs, one income =
usable funding received; amounts > 0.005 only) as the 8th parameter of
`calculateProjection` — rendered with `source: 'budget'` and deep-linking to
`/budgets/{id}`. Errors never break the cashflow projection. Elapsed confirmed months
disappear behind the reconciliation anchor naturally — see
[projections-and-reconciliation.md](projections-and-reconciliation.md).

**Regular income** (`includeRegularIncome`) is pulled into the budget page
**display-only** via the existing `getProjection` (excluding `source === 'budget'`
lines); it never enters the out-of-pocket math and is never injected back — no double
counting by construction.

### Expense log & CSV export

`BudgetExpenseEntry.date` is a plain `'YYYY-MM-DD'` string (month = `date.slice(0, 7)`,
never `new Date()` parsing). Exports (`src/lib/budget-csv.ts` on top of
`src/lib/csv-utils.ts`): `buildExpenseLogCsv` (itemized spending log with a total row)
and `buildBudgetSummaryCsv` (planned vs. spent per category + funding-source section).
`toCsv` emits **semicolon delimiter + UTF-8 BOM + CRLF + comma decimals**
(`formatCsvNumber`) so files open correctly by double-click in fi-FI Excel;
`downloadCsv` triggers the browser download.

Budget UI categories come from the short `BUDGET_CATEGORIES` list in
`src/lib/constants.ts` (Accommodation, Travel, Local transport, Food, Insurance, Fees,
Equipment, Other) — not the cashflow `ITEM_CATEGORIES`.

### UI

`/budgets` is the merged **"Trips & Budgets"** page (nav entry `budgets`, label
"Trips & Budgets", `MdLuggage`): two stacked sections — Trips first
(`src/components/trips/trips-section.tsx`, `<section id="trips">`) then Budgets
(`src/components/budgets/budgets-section.tsx`, `<section id="budgets">`, the budget
list with `budget-card.tsx`) — fetched together (`Promise.all([getBudgets, getTrips,
getAccounts])`, one `loaded` flag + refresh callback). `/budgets/[id]` is the
single-page budget editor, unchanged. Components in `src/components/budgets/`:
`budget-setup-wizard.tsx` (4 steps: "The plan",
"What it costs", "Who's paying", "Does it add up?"; templates in
`budget-templates.ts`), `budget-verdict-card.tsx` (feasibility headline),
`budget-coverage-bars.tsx`, `budget-vs-actual-bars.tsx`, `budget-month-chart.tsx`,
`budget-expense-log.tsx`, `budget-confirm-dialog.tsx`, `budget-export-dialog.tsx`,
`budget-dialogs.tsx` / `budget-panels.tsx` (line/funding editors).

## 3. Goals

Financial targets tracked against a projection, surfaced at **`/goals`**
(`src/app/(dashboard)/goals/page.tsx`): a budgets-style card grid with a
`ProgressBar`, on-track/behind/achieved `Tag`, projected reach date, archived
toggle, and a create/edit dialog (`src/components/goals/goal-dialog.tsx`, RHF +
`zodResolver(goalSchema)`; the account dropdown appears for `account-balance`
goals — `goalSchema` superRefines `linkedAccountId` required then — and a manual
amount input for `manual` goals). Nav entry `goals` in `nav-config.tsx`
(`MdFlag`; with the default tabs it lands in the mobile "More" drawer in Advanced
mode, while in Simple mode it is one of the four default bottom tabs, replacing
Overview — see `DEFAULT_BOTTOM_NAV_IDS_SIMPLE` in `src/lib/bottom-nav-prefs.ts`;
either way a user can put it on the bottom bar from Settings → General → Mobile
navigation) and a `nav-goals` command in the command palette.

**Goal type**: every goal is either a **reserve** (default; money set aside and
kept — never removed from a projection) or a **spend** goal (an amount you plan to
actually spend at the target date). A spend goal tracked against an account
balance, with a target date, may opt into **`injectIntoCashflow`**: the target
amount is then injected as a real read-only expense line (`Goal: {name}`, category
`Goals`, `source: 'goal'`) in the linked account's cashflow at the target month —
see `getGoalTransfersForAccount` in
[projections-and-reconciliation.md](projections-and-reconciliation.md) §5. The
single predicate deciding whether a goal injects,
`goalInjectsIntoCashflow(goal)` (`src/lib/goal-utils.ts`), is shared by that
gatherer and the goal-plan engine below — it requires `goalType === 'spend'`,
`injectIntoCashflow: true`, a `targetDate`, `trackingMethod ===
'account-balance'`, a `linkedAccountId`, and not archived.

**Priority & the joint funding plan**: an optional `priority` (lower funds
first; unset sorts after every prioritized goal, ordered by target date, then
name — `compareGoalsForPlan`) lets goals that compete for the same money queue
up realistically instead of each pretending it has the whole pool to itself.
Active goals are planned jointly by `computeGoalPlan(goals, cashProjections,
wealthProjections)`:

- **Pools**: an account-balance goal draws on its linked account's balance;
  a net-worth goal draws on total net worth. **Every** non-manual goal's claim
  (its `targetAmount`, held as a constant reservation) also reduces the
  net-worth pool — an account reservation is spoken-for wealth at the
  whole-net-worth level too, so a net-worth goal sees less headroom once an
  earlier account-balance goal has claimed its share.
- **The double-claim guard**: an injecting goal's claim drops to **0** from its
  target month onward — by then the expense line has already removed the money
  from the projection, so reserving it again would double-count it. The
  injecting goal's own evaluation, symmetrically, **adds its target amount
  back** for months at/after the target date, so its own feasibility is judged
  against the pre-spend balance.
- Manual goals are **standalone** — no pool, no claims, unaffected by (and
  invisible to) the plan.
- Each `GoalPlanEntry` also carries `competingGoalIds` (earlier goals sharing a
  pool), `claimedAheadNow`, and `requiredMonthlySaving` (`max(0, targetAmount −
  currentAmount) / monthsUntil(targetDate)`, `null` with no target date, once
  already reached, or `targetDatePassed: true`). `GoalCard` surfaces these as an
  "After N other goal(s)" caption and a "Save ~€X/mo…" line.

Archived goals are **not** planned jointly (no claims to reason about) and keep
the standalone `calculateGoalProgress` path.

**Progress data is assembled client-side**: `getProjection(accountId)` is called
for every account an active goal links, and `fetchWealthProjectionMonths`
(`src/lib/wealth-assembly.ts` — the Overview wealth assembly extracted into a
reusable client helper) runs whenever **any** active non-manual goal exists (an
account-balance goal's claim needs the net-worth pool too, not just net-worth
goals). A goal whose linked account no longer exists shows a warning on its card
(progress 0). Amounts display in the goal's currency, no conversion. The backend:

- **Type** `Goal` (`src/types/index.ts`): `targetAmount`, `currency`,
  `targetDate?: string` (**`YYYY-MM`**), `trackingMethod`, `linkedAccountId?`,
  `currentManualAmount?`, `goalType?: 'reserve' | 'spend'` (readers default
  missing to `'reserve'` — **no migration of stored goals**), `priority?: number
  | null`, `injectIntoCashflow?: boolean`, `isArchived?`, plus
  `CreateGoalRequest` / `UpdateGoalRequest`.
- **DB** (`src/lib/db/goals.ts`): one file per goal at
  `data/users/{id}/goals/{id}.enc`; `getGoals` returns goals **sorted by name**
  (archived ones included).
- **Cached queries**: `cachedGetGoals` / `cachedGetGoalById` in `src/lib/db/cached.ts`,
  tag `user:{userId}:goals`.
- **Actions** (`src/lib/actions/goals.ts`): `getGoals`, `getGoalById`, `createGoal`,
  `updateGoal` (accepts `isArchived`), `deleteGoal` — standard auth + Zod + `updateTag`.
  The action-layer Zod schemas mirror the client `goalSchema`'s `superRefine`:
  `injectIntoCashflow: true` requires `goalType === 'spend'`, a `targetDate`, and
  `trackingMethod === 'account-balance'`, or the request is rejected server-side
  even if a client bypasses the form. Clearing `priority` must send `null`
  (`.nullable()`) — `undefined` is dropped by server-action serialization.
- **Form schema**: `goalSchema` in `src/lib/schemas/goal.schema.ts` (no
  schema-level `.default()` on `goalType` — that would diverge zod's input/output
  types and break the RHF resolver's inference; the dialog always sends an
  explicit value).
- **Pure engine** (`src/lib/goal-utils.ts`):
  - `calculateGoalProgress(goal, cashProjections?, wealthProjections?)` →
    `{ currentAmount, targetAmount, percentComplete (clamped [0,100]),
    projectedAmountAtTarget, onTrack, projectedDate }`. Tracking methods:
    - `'manual'` — `currentAmount = currentManualAmount`; on-track ⇔ 100%;
    - `'account-balance'` — reads the linked account's monthly projections
      (current = first month's `startingBalance`; `projectedDate` = first month
      whose `endingBalance ≥ target`);
    - `'net-worth'` — same logic against `WealthProjectionMonth.netWorth`.
  - `goalInjectsIntoCashflow(goal)` — the injection predicate (see above).
  - `compareGoalsForPlan(a, b)` — the joint-plan ordering (see above).
  - `computeGoalPlan(goals, cashProjections, wealthProjections): { entries:
    GoalPlanEntry[] }` — the joint funding plan (see above). Caller passes
    **active** goals only.

  Goals only **read** projections for their own progress computation; the one
  exception is an injecting spend goal, which **writes back** a real expense
  line via `GoalTransfer` (§5 of
  [projections-and-reconciliation.md](projections-and-reconciliation.md)) —
  every other goal type/mode still never feeds back into the cashflow/wealth
  engines.

## 4. Trips (Vero.fi per-diem calculator)

Tax-exempt per-diem allowances for business travel, surfaced as the **Trips section
of the merged "Trips & Budgets" page at `/budgets`**
(`src/components/trips/trips-section.tsx`, `<section id="trips">`, rendered above
the Budgets section; `/trips` is a server `redirect('/budgets')` for old links and
stays in `PROTECTED_PREFIXES`): a Goals-style card grid (name, destination,
departure→return date/time + duration, status `Tag`, per-diem total, linked
account, reimbursement month, quick status-advance button) with a collapsed
"reimbursed" section, and a create/edit dialog
(`src/components/trips/trip-dialog.tsx`, RHF + `zodResolver(tripSchema)`) plus a
presentational `PerDiemBreakdown` component. There is no separate `trips` nav entry
(the `budgets` entry covers both; hidden in Simple mode — reachable from Home's
feature grid); the command palette keeps a `nav-trips` command ("Go to Trips (per
diem)") routing to `/budgets`, and cashflow `trip` lines deep-link to
`/budgets#trips`.

**The rules** (Finnish Tax Administration decision VH/6575/00.01.00/2025,
implemented in `src/lib/per-diem-utils.ts` against the euro amounts in
`src/lib/per-diem-rates.ts`):

- The trip is measured from departure to return date/time
  (`computeTripHours` — parses both as **local** date/times and diffs epoch ms at
  minute precision; a trip crossing a DST transition is off by ±1h from the literal
  wall-clock span, an accepted simplification). Each full 24h slice from departure
  is a "travel day" earning a **full** per diem at that slice's country rate
  (domestic €54, else that country's listed rate, or €52 for an unlisted
  destination).
- The trailing remainder slice (R hours left over):
  - **No full day at all** (whole trip < 24h), domestic: R > 10h → full (€54);
    R > 6h → partial (€25); else nothing.
  - **No full day at all, foreign**: R ≥ 10h → the country's full per diem (§13:
    "lasting a minimum of 10 hours"); under 10h the **domestic** provisions and
    amounts apply instead (R > 6h → domestic partial €25); else nothing.
  - **≥ 1 full day, remainder lands back in Finland**: R ≥ 2h → extra partial
    (€25); R > 6h → extra full (€54) instead (checked full-first, since R > 6h
    implies R ≥ 2h).
  - **≥ 1 full day, remainder abroad**: R > 10h → full country rate; R > 2h → half
    the country rate (`half-foreign`); else nothing.
- **Free meals**: a full or half-foreign day is halved at 2+ free meals (§13
  defines foreign "free meals" as two meals); a domestic partial day is halved at
  1+ free meal (§12). A per-day manual `overrideAmount` always wins, applied
  after the meal reduction.
- Each day is rounded to cents; the trip total is the sum.

**Per-day country attribution & simplifications**: `TripDay.countryCode` is
editable per day (a `Dropdown` in the day editor) — the day list defaults every
full slice to the trip's `destinationCountry` and the remainder slice to the last
full day's (possibly edited) country, or the destination when there's no full
day (`generateTripDays`), but a multi-leg trip is modeled entirely through these
per-day overrides, not a route. There's no kilometre/mileage allowance — only the
daily per-diem. `generateTripDays` re-runs on every start/end/destination change
and preserves existing per-day edits (country/meals/override) by matching the new
slice's calendar date against the old one, falling back to the same slice index
when dates shifted (a simple, deterministic rule, not a diff/merge).

**Rate snapshotting**: every `Trip` stores the rates in effect at creation
(`TripRateSnapshot`: `domesticFull`, `domesticPartial`, `defaultForeign`,
`countryRates`), prefilled from `buildDefaultRateSnapshot()`
(`src/lib/per-diem-rates.ts`) on create and editable in a collapsed "Per-diem
rates" panel in the dialog — so a later year's rate-table update never
retroactively changes an already-planned or already-reimbursed trip.

**Cashflow injection**: a trip with `status !== 'reimbursed'` injects
`calculatePerDiem(trip).total` as a read-only `source: 'trip'` income line
("Per diem: {name}") in its linked account's cashflow at
`expectedReimbursementMonth` — see `getTripTransfersForAccount` in
[projections-and-reconciliation.md](projections-and-reconciliation.md) §5.
Advancing status to `'reimbursed'` (a one-click action on the trip card) stops the
injection; the card surfaces that consequence as a hint the moment a trip is
marked `'completed'`. A trip whose per-diem is **already funded through an active
(confirmed, account-linked) budget** via `linkedTripId` also stops injecting its own
line — the guard `tripIdsFundedByActiveBudgets` in `getTripTransfersForAccount` (see
§Budgets → "Double-count guard") — so the budget's funding-income line isn't
double-counted. The backend:

- **Type** `Trip` (`src/types/index.ts`): `destinationCountry`, `startDateTime` /
  `endDateTime` (**`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`**, local), `days: TripDay[]`, `rates:
  TripRateSnapshot`, `linkedAccountId`, `expectedReimbursementMonth` (**`YYYY-MM`**),
  `status: 'planned' | 'completed' | 'reimbursed'`, `notes?`, plus
  `CreateTripRequest` / `UpdateTripRequest`.
- **DB** (`src/lib/db/trips.ts`): one file per trip at
  `data/users/{id}/trips/{id}.enc`; `getTrips` returns trips sorted by
  `startDateTime` descending (newest first).
- **Cached queries**: `cachedGetTrips` / `cachedGetTripById` in
  `src/lib/db/cached.ts`, tag `user:{userId}:trips`.
- **Actions** (`src/lib/actions/trips.ts`): `getTrips`, `getTripById`,
  `createTrip`, `updateTrip`, `deleteTrip` — standard auth + Zod + `updateTag`.
- **Form/action schema**: `tripSchema` / `updateTripSchema` in
  `src/lib/schemas/trip.schema.ts` (day/rate-snapshot sub-schemas; refines
  `endDateTime > startDateTime`).
- **Pure engine** (`src/lib/per-diem-utils.ts`, unit-tested): `computeTripHours`,
  `computeSliceCount`, `generateTripDays`, `resolveDayRate`, `calculatePerDiem(trip)
  → { days: TravelDayBreakdown[], total }`.

Trips only **write** into the cashflow projection via this one injected income
line — there's no other read-back, and (unlike Goals) there's no joint-funding
plan to reason about since a per-diem total is a fixed, self-contained
computation rather than a pool claim.

## 5. Home dashboard (`/`)

`src/app/page.tsx` is a server component: it `auth()`-guards (redirects to
`/auth/signin`) and **wraps `AppLayout` itself** — the root route sits outside the
`(dashboard)` route group, so it doesn't get the group layout's wrapper. It renders
`HomeDashboard` (`src/components/home/home-dashboard.tsx`, client), which shows:

- a **bank-connection attention banner** (`BankAttentionBanner`, shared with Overview's
  `BannerStack` — see [bank-sync.md](bank-sync.md) §11) when a connection needs attention
  (expired/expiring consent or a failing sync), fetched independently via
  `getBankConnectionsNeedingAttention` so it never delays the glance; its action button
  routes to `/bank`, where the "Renew consent" button lives;
- a **top glance row** — bank balances first, the projection beside them:
  - an **"Accounts & cards" strip**: compact per-account tiles (2-col grid) from the
    `getHomeBankGlance` action — every non-excluded bank link with at least one
    transaction in the last 30 days (`txDisplayDate`, any status — a pending row counts
    as activity); cash/savings tiles show `lastBalance` (negative in red), card tiles
    show live used amount `/ limit` (`effectiveCardNumbers`) with a thin used-ratio bar
    (amber at ≥80%; no bar when no limit is known). Tiles link to `/bank`, follow the
    user's `bankAccountOrder`, format each in its own currency (no aggregate), and the
    strip disappears entirely when bank sync is unconfigured or nothing was active;
  - the **"this month" glance tile**: the primary account's projected end-of-month
    balance + a one-line sentiment ("You're on track" / spending-more-than-earning /
    ends-in-the-red), computed from `getProjection` for the first non-archived account
    (fetched independently so it never blocks the split data). Beside the strip it
    renders compact (`sm:w-64`); with no strip it reverts to full width. Tapping it
    opens a **plain-words breakdown dialog** (starting balance + income − spending =
    expected end balance, with an Overview link inside). The region's skeleton waits
    for the bank fetch too — the row's geometry depends on whether bank rows exist;
- a greeting (adding a shared expense happens via the global quick-add FAB — see
  §1 — which is always visible on Home);
- one merged **Split card**: an overall-position line from `aggregatePairwiseNets`'
  `totalByCurrency` (single currency → colored owed/owe amount; several → a neutral
  "Balances across multiple currencies" — never a naive cross-currency sum), an
  "All groups" link, per-group **tiles** in a 2-col (3-col ≥sm) grid (emoji, name,
  counterparty avatar, "you're owed / you owe €X" phrase that wraps rather than
  truncates), then a divided **Recent activity** section: `getSplitActivity(5)` (reads
  only each group's newest ~3 month chunks) rendered by `SplitActivityFeed`
  (`emptyText="No recent activity"`), showing each actor's `<UserAvatar>` and
  `added by {actorName}` ("added by You" for own rows); clicking an event navigates to
  its group;
- a **feature grid** built from the shared `navItems` (minus `home`).

On mount it also runs `catchUpGroupRecurrences` for every group (cheap no-op when
nothing is due) and registers itself as the AppContext refresh callback.

## 6. Overview (`/overview`)

`src/app/(dashboard)/overview/page.tsx` (client component) is the wealth dashboard; its
own `AGENTS.md` in the same directory has the full breakdown. Summary:

- **KPI tiles**: net worth = cash + investments + receivables − debts − card
  liabilities + mortgage equity + split net. Rendered with the shared `KpiTile`
  (`src/components/ui/kpi-tile.tsx`; zero-delta badges suppressed) in **grouped
  sections** — Net / Assets / Debts & liabilities (`KpiGroup`,
  `src/components/overview/kpi-group.tsx`, 2-col grid on mobile). In **Simple mode**
  only Net Worth + Cash show, behind a "See all balances" expander; jargon-y tile
  titles use their plain-language wording there (`plainTerm` from
  `src/lib/plain-language.ts`, e.g. Receivables → "Money owed to you"), and dense
  tiles carry a `HelpHint` "?" tooltip in both modes. Clicking the **Net Worth tile**
  opens `NetWorthExplainDialog` (`src/components/overview/net-worth-explain-dialog.tsx`),
  a plain-words row-by-row breakdown whose rows mirror the net-worth sum exactly.
  Cash uses each
  account's **latest snapshot balance** (bank-sync or manual reconciliation, via
  `getLatestSnapshot('cash-account', …)`) with `startingBalance` as fallback
  (`cashCurrentBalances`). A **"Credit cards"** tile (negative, from
  `getCardLiabilities`) appears when outstanding > 0, with an available-of-limit
  subline + utilization bar when the bank exposes limits; a **"Split balance"** tile
  appears when the net ≠ 0 (see §1) — under Assets when positive, under Debts when
  negative. Clicking a tile opens the `EntityListDrawer`
  (`src/components/ui/entity-list-drawer.tsx`) for create/edit/archive.
- **Wealth distribution bar** ("Where your wealth sits", `WealthDistribution` in
  `src/components/overview/wealth-distribution.tsx`): a slim CSS segmented bar + legend
  below the KPI tiles showing how the current asset total splits across Cash,
  Investments, Receivables, Home equity and a positive Split balance — colored from the
  shared `WEALTH_COLORS` map, `role="img"` with a generated `aria-label` (no
  `ChartExplain`, since it is not a canvas chart), shown in **both** display modes, with
  a footer sentence reconciling assets minus debts/cards/owed-split to the Net Worth KPI.
- **Banners** (all via the shared `AlertBanner` in `BannerStack`,
  `src/components/overview/banner-stack.tsx`): monthly **check-in due** (no snapshot
  for the current month, or months behind the last one — opens the reconciliation
  wizard; can be turned off via `UserPreferences.checkInRemindersEnabled` in
  Settings → General → Reminders, for bank-synced users who rarely need manual
  check-ins), **Euribor due** (`isEuriborUpdateDue`, see [mortgage.md](mortgage.md)),
  and **bank consent renewal** (`getBankConnectionsNeedingAttention`, deep-links to
  `/settings?tab=banking` — see [bank-sync.md](bank-sync.md)). The Overview header's
  "Monthly check-in" button is the primary check-in affordance, but it **hides while
  the check-in reminder banner shows** (`isCheckInBannerVisible`) so there is a single
  entry point; it is deliberately **not** in the sidebar/top-bar chrome (still
  reachable via ⌘M and the command palette).
- **Net-worth projection chart**: a **Total assets / Liquid** `SelectButton`
  (`wealthScope`, default `total`) plus a toggle between net-worth-only and
  breakdown series, horizon selector `6M / 1Y / 3Y / 5Y` (default `1y`).
  `WealthChart` (`src/components/charts/wealth-chart.tsx`) draws **stacked bands**
  per scope — total: Cash, Investments, Receivables, Home value (assets) /
  Debts, Credit cards, Mortgage (liabilities); liquid: Cash, Investments, Debts,
  Credit cards — plus a **Net worth line overlay** (Chart.js's legend is the
  chart's only legend, shown in both modes; there is no separate hard-coded HTML
  legend), omitting any all-zero series. `net-worth-chart.tsx` reuses the shared
  `WEALTH_COLORS` / `wealthCategoriesForScope()` / `computeScopedNetWorth()`
  exports from `wealth-chart.tsx`; its tooltip enumerates every in-scope
  non-zero category.
- **This-month impact panel**: top income/expense lines for the current month; account
  balance lines use the same `cashCurrentBalances` values as the Cash KPI.
- Mortgage equity/liability come from running `calculateMortgageProjection` for the
  member's active mortgages and folding positions into the wealth projection
  (`mortgageProjections` + `currentUserId` guard in `src/lib/wealth-projection.ts`).

## 7. Onboarding wizard & command palette

- **Onboarding** (`src/components/onboarding/onboarding-wizard.tsx`): five steps —
  Welcome, Cash Account, Income (either a "Simple Amount" or a "Full Salary" config;
  the salary rates **prefill from `UserPreferences.taxDefaults`**, with "not sure?
  pick Simple Amount" guidance), Expenses, Done. The Done step asks **"How much
  detail do you want to see?"** and persists the answer as the display mode
  (`setDisplayMode`); finishing lands on Home (`/`). Creates the first account plus
  starter recurring items.
- **Command palette** (`src/components/ui/command-palette.tsx`): navigation commands
  `nav-home`, `nav-split`, `nav-overview`, `nav-cashflow`, `nav-mortgage`,
  `nav-budgets` ("Go to Trips & Budgets"), `nav-goals`, `nav-trips` ("Go to Trips
  (per diem)" — routes to `/budgets`, same as `nav-budgets`), `nav-bank`,
  `nav-playground`, `nav-settings` (each with a path in the
  `executeCommand` `paths` map) and action commands `action-reconcile`,
  `action-add-income`, `action-add-expense`, `action-add-split-expense`, plus a dynamic
  `dynamic-add` entry. New pages must add both a `nav-config.tsx` entry and a palette
  command (see root `AGENTS.md`, "Adding things").

## 8. Playground ("What If?", `/playground`)

Ephemeral scenario explorer: `runScenarioProjection` (`src/lib/actions/scenario.ts`)
clones the live projection inputs, applies the requested modifications
(`add-income` / `add-expense` / `remove-item` / `modify-amount`; an `add-*` mod may
carry `isOneOff`/`scheduledDate` to model a one-off event), and runs the real
engine twice — nothing is persisted and no cache tag exists. Engine details in
[projections-and-reconciliation.md](projections-and-reconciliation.md). The page
(`src/app/(dashboard)/playground/page.tsx`, subtitle "Test changes against your real
plan — the same account, income, and bills as your Cashflow — without saving
anything.") adds the account picker, the modification form, and the
current-vs-modified delta view on top, plus:

- **Templates over real items**: besides the add-income/add-expense templates,
  "Cancel an existing expense" and "Change an item's amount" fetch the account's
  real recurring + planned items into a grouped Dropdown and emit
  `remove-item`/`modify-amount` mods.
- **One-off events**: the frequency picker's "Once" option + a month picker send
  `isOneOff: true`/`scheduledDate` ('YYYY-MM'); `applyScenarioModifications` turns
  those into a synthetic one-off `PlannedItem` (`scenario-…` id) instead of a
  recurring item.
- **Staged changes**: "Add another change" stacks 2–3 modifications (chips with
  remove) so one run can answer "raise **and** a new car payment"; a filled form
  joins the run implicitly, keeping the single-change flow one tap.
- **Comparison chart**: a lazy ECharts "Balance over time" line chart
  (`src/components/charts/scenario-comparison-chart.tsx`) draws the dashed Current
  plan vs the solid With-changes series over the full horizon, with a dashed zero
  markLine and a red null-gapped overlay series tracing below-zero stretches
  (deliberately **not** an ECharts `visualMap`, which ECharts 6 applies unreliably
  to 1-D line data).
- **KPIs**: end balance current/modified/difference plus a **"Lowest point"** tile
  (minimum `endingBalance` + its month, red when below zero).
- **Recent runs**: a session-local list of the last 5 runs' labels + end-balance
  deltas for quick comparison (component state only — nothing stored).
- **"Add to my plan"**: after a run, each staged `add-income`/`add-expense` gets a
  button that materializes it as a real item — recurring via `createRecurringItem`
  (start month = current), or a one-off via `createPlannedItem` — with a toast and
  the AppContext refresh.

## 9. Data-integration conveniences

- **Recurring-transaction suggestions** (`/bank`): `detectRecurringCandidates`
  (`src/lib/recurring-detection.ts`, pure/tested — ≥3 consecutive months, day ±3,
  amount ±20% of median, one charge/month, no matching tracked item by name or
  amount, and **still recurring**: the latest occurrence must be in the current
  or previous month, else the pattern is treated as stopped and skipped)
  drives `getRecurringSuggestions(accountId)` (`src/lib/actions/bank.ts`,
  which also feeds the account's injected mortgage-transfer amounts (last 12
  months, via `getMortgageTransfersForAccount`) into the existing-item matcher
  so the monthly mortgage payment is never proposed — it's already in the plan
  as a `mortgage-payment` line,
  computed on demand from cached reads). `RecurringSuggestions`
  (`src/components/bank/recurring-suggestions.tsx`) renders "Track this?" cards:
  one tap creates the real recurring item; Dismiss is per-device
  (localStorage `sampolio-dismissed-suggestions`).
- **"Split this" from a bank row** (`/bank` ledger): spend rows get a Split-this
  action — a desktop column and, on mobile, a button that's a **sibling** of the
  row's expand chevron (visible without expanding; nested buttons are invalid
  HTML) — that opens `QuickAddSplitModal` prefilled (`initial` prop: title =
  counterparty, amount, date, `guessCategory`, plus `bankLink` so the created
  expense is linked back to the transaction — see §1 "Bank-transaction linking")
  — hosted inside `bank-ledger-table.tsx`, no drawer plumbing. Duplicate
  warnings, recovered pending→booked suggestions, and confirmation behavior
  are defined in §1 "Bank-transaction linking" above; the ledger shows the
  corresponding flag pill.
- **Plan check card** (Overview): `PlanCheckCard`
  (`src/components/overview/forecast-vs-actual-card.tsx`, purely presentational — the
  page passes the primary account's `monthly` + `retrospective` from its existing
  `getProjection` calls) with two views behind a month toggle, default via
  `pickDefaultView`. **Last month**: `comparePlanToActual`
  (`src/lib/forecast-vs-actual.ts`, pure/tested) joins the *recurring* part of the
  current plan (one-off planned items and injected card/mortgage/budget lines
  excluded; past forecasts aren't stored) with the last retrospective month's actuals
  by category — actual lines re-categorized from merchant names via
  `guessItemCategory`, card-settlement lines dropped symmetrically with the plan side.
  Top-4 off-plan rows render worded verdicts ("€X more/less than planned"), a bullet
  bar (actual fill, plan tick) and expand to the actual merchant lines; on-plan count
  and unmatched-spend footers close the view (`onPlanTolerance` = max(€5, 3% of
  planned)). **This month**: `summarizeMonthProgress` over the actualized current
  month — "€X of €Y" progress per category, never judged, expanding to per-item
  paid/"€X left" tags. Hidden only when there's neither a retrospective nor an
  actualized month.
- **Euribor prefill**: `fetchCurrentEuribor12m()` (`src/lib/actions/euribor.ts`)
  fetches the latest 12-month Euribor from the ECB Data Portal
  (series `FM.M.U2.EUR.RT.MM.EURIBOR1YD_.HSTA`, csvdata, 5s timeout, 6h in-memory
  TTL, always-graceful failure) and prefills the Euribor dialog's rate while the
  field still holds its opening default, with a "Prefilled from ECB Data Portal —
  confirm before saving" note. Never auto-applies.
- **Check-in notification** (opt-in): `UserPreferences.checkInNotificationsEnabled`
  (Settings → General → Reminders, "Also notify on this device"; requests
  Notification permission on enable). `CheckinNotifier`
  (`src/components/providers/checkin-notifier.tsx`, mounted in AppLayout) shows one
  local notification per month (`sampolio-checkin-notified-YYYY-MM` in
  localStorage) via the service worker when the check-in is due (`isCheckInDue`,
  `src/lib/checkin-utils.ts` — shared with the Overview banner); `public/sw.js`
  has a `notificationclick` handler opening `/overview`. No push service.
- **Budget ↔ split link**: see §Budgets (`linkedSplitGroupId`) — the viewer's share
  of a linked group's expenses in the budget period renders read-only via
  `buildSplitBudgetEntries` (`src/lib/budget-utils.ts`); never persisted, never in
  feasibility/cashflow math.

## 10. Demo mode (UI-only money masking)

A device-local privacy toggle for showing the app to friends: when on, every monetary value
rendered through `formatCurrency` (and its wrapper `formatCents`) is replaced by a fixed
placeholder mask `€✱✱✱,✱✱` (U+2731 asterisks, U+2212 negatives) — chart *shapes* stay real,
only their axis/label/tooltip text masks. Mechanism (`src/lib/demo-mode.ts`):

- **A process-wide flag on `globalThis`, not React state.** `formatCurrency` is a pure formatter
  called from hundreds of non-component call sites (chart option builders, table cell renderers,
  CSV builders) that can't subscribe to context, so a single boolean
  (`setDemoMask`/`isDemoMasked`) lets every formatter branch synchronously. The slot lives on
  `globalThis` (not a module-scoped `let`) because production chunking may instantiate a shared
  module once per chunk graph — a module-local flag set by AppLayout's copy could then disagree
  with the copy a lazy chart chunk's tooltip formatter reads, leaving masked/unmasked values that
  survive a toggle until a reload. `AppLayout` is the sole writer and syncs it **during render**
  (before returning JSX) from `demoMode`, so the first paint after a toggle already formats
  correctly. `demo-mode.ts` has **zero imports** so `constants.ts` can import it without a cycle.
- **Persistence is per-device** localStorage (`DEMO_MODE_STORAGE_KEY = 'demo-mode'`), NOT a
  `UserPreferences` field — it's about the screen you're showing, not the account. AppLayout also
  listens for `storage` events, so toggling in one tab/window (e.g. the installed PWA) updates
  every other open tab of the origin.
- **No exempt pages**: every page masks, `/mortgage` and `/split` included.
- **NOT masked**: `formatRate`, input fields, and CSV/JSON exports (only display formatting).
- **Chart-memo dep + remount-key rule** (future code must follow): any ECharts `option` `useMemo`
  that calls `formatCurrency` MUST list `demoMasked` (`useAppContext().demoMasked`) in its deps,
  AND the `<ReactEChartsCore>` element carries `key={demoMasked ? 'masked' : 'plain'}` so a toggle
  remounts the instance — a fresh option/instance is the only guarantee that no internally-cached
  label or tooltip string survives the flip. Done for monthly-flow, cashflow-waterfall,
  expense-treemap, scenario-comparison, split-spend, split-net, mortgage-sankey (Chart.js charts
  rebuild options during render and their tooltip callbacks read the flag at hover time — no key
  needed).
- **Memoized-widget remount-key rule** (future code must follow): PrimeReact components with
  memoized internals won't re-run `formatCurrency` on a bare re-render, so any long-lived widget
  that bakes money into cells or templates remounts via `key={demoMasked ? 'masked' : 'plain'}` —
  the money `DataTable`s (projection-table, bank-ledger-table, budget-expense-log, and
  mortgage-ledger-table, whose composite key carries a demo segment) and the cashflow header's
  account-selector `Dropdown` (money in its `valueTemplate`); modals mount fresh so they need no
  key.
- **Toggle surfaces**: the user-menu item (`nav-config.tsx`) and the command palette
  (`action-demo-mode`); AppLayout renders a fixed "Demo" indicator pill (z-45, above mobile
  chrome, below overlays — eye-off icon, click to exit). Context exposes
  `demoMode`/`demoMasked`/`setDemoMode`.

## 11. Simple vs Advanced display mode

`UserPreferences.displayMode` (`'simple' | 'advanced'`) drives a per-user progressive-disclosure
mode, read from `useAppContext().displayMode`. Conventions:

- **Resolution**: `AppLayout` resolves an *unset* preference to **`simple` for users who have not
  completed onboarding** and `advanced` for pre-existing accounts (`app-layout.tsx`). Onboarding's
  Done step asks "How much detail do you want to see?" and persists the choice via `setDisplayMode`.
- **Collapse, never remove**: simple mode hides complexity behind expanders ("See all balances",
  "Show details") or falls back to the advanced UI — no feature becomes unreachable. Current scope:
  Overview (Net Worth + Cash tiles only; plain-language KPI labels via `plainTerm`), Cashflow
  ("Money in / Money out / Left over" banner with a sentiment sentence; charts + all-months table
  behind "Show details"), Mortgage (`MyMortgageSummaryCard` personal card; per-loan cards and
  advanced charts hidden), Settings (Data & Storage + Admin tabs hidden), and the reconcile wizard
  (one-screen check-in: auto-starts on the current month, single "Save check-in" button).
- **Nav slimming**: nav entries carry `simpleModeVisible` in `nav-config.tsx`; every surface renders
  from `useVisibleNavItems()` (sidebar, drawer) or, for the bottom-nav, from
  `resolveBottomNavIds()` — whose per-mode defaults `DEFAULT_BOTTOM_NAV_IDS` /
  `DEFAULT_BOTTOM_NAV_IDS_SIMPLE` (`src/lib/bottom-nav-prefs.ts`) swap Overview for Goals in
  Simple mode. Simple mode shows Home, Split, Cashflow, Goals, Settings; everything else
  stays reachable from Home's feature grid (which deliberately lists **all** `navItems`) and the
  command palette. A user's own bottom-nav pick (`UserPreferences.bottomNavIds`, chosen in
  Settings → General → Mobile navigation) overrides the default in BOTH modes.
- **Explain-the-number dialogs**: the Home glance tile and the Overview Net Worth KPI open
  plain-words breakdowns (`home-dashboard.tsx` dialog, `net-worth-explain-dialog.tsx`) built from
  data already on the page — display-only, in both modes.

## 12. User avatars

Optional per-user profile picture, shown wherever a person is displayed (split balance
banner/detail, settle-up dropdowns, activity-feed actors, split list cards + summary rows, Home
split widget, mortgage member cards + members dialog, admin users table + edit dialog, Settings →
Account "Profile picture" block).

- **Storage is a PLAIN, UNENCRYPTED binary** at `data/users/{id}/avatar.webp` (256×256 WebP) —
  deliberate: it enables zero-decrypt streaming + HTTP caching, and an avatar is low-sensitivity.
  It is **excluded from the JSON backup** (`data-transfer.ts` never touches it). `User.avatarVersion?: number`
  is the only encrypted-record field; `setUserAvatar(userId, Buffer | null)` (`src/lib/db/users.ts`)
  writes/removes the file and bumps the version.
- **Served by `src/app/api/avatars/[userId]/route.ts`** (the SECOND non-auth API route,
  alongside the bank callback): session-gated, a `^[A-Za-z0-9-]+$` userId guard (blocks path
  traversal), `Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000, immutable`, and a `?v={avatarVersion}`
  cache-buster from `avatarUrlFor`. Node runtime (needs `fs`). In `proxy.ts`, cookie-bearing requests are exempt
  from rate limiting and this path is not auth-redirected.
- **Read path**: `PublicUser.avatarUrl` is computed by `toPublicUser` / `avatarUrlFor`
  (`db/users.ts`); `UserProfile { id, name, avatarUrl? }` is returned by `getUserProfiles`
  (`src/lib/actions/user-profiles.ts`) to **any** authenticated user (no email/role leaked, so it
  is safe for cross-user member displays). Client: `<UserAvatar>` (`src/components/ui/user-avatar.tsx`,
  renders the image or initials on a deterministic `getAvatarColor` hsl hash from `avatar-utils.ts`),
  the `useUserProfiles` hook (`src/lib/hooks/use-user-profiles.ts`, module cache + inflight dedup +
  `invalidateUserProfiles`), and `AvatarEditorDialog` (drop/paste/browse → EXIF-normalized ≤2048px
  source → `react-easy-crop` round crop + zoom [lazy-loaded dependency] → 256×256 WebP q0.85,
  JPEG fallback).
- **Write path**: `updateMyAvatar` (`actions/account.ts`, self); admin `updateUser` accepts an
  `avatarDataUri` field (`avatarDataUriSchema` in `src/lib/schemas/user.schema.ts`).
- **Cache invalidation is the `users` tag only** — the avatar is **never denormalized** into shared
  split/mortgage docs (those carry names only), and is **not** in the session JWT (cookie size);
  every avatar render resolves through the route + `useUserProfiles`.
