/**
 * Enable Banking — credit-card billing engine (pure, no I/O, fully testable).
 *
 * AIS rarely exposes statement-close / due dates, so they're configured per card.
 * Given those days + the card's transactions (and/or a known statement balance),
 * this derives:
 *   - the firm bill for the most recent CLOSED statement (due on the next
 *     payment-due date) — injected into the paying account's cashflow, PLUS the
 *     previous closed statement's bill for as long as its due month is still
 *     current-or-future (the statement-day rollover would otherwise drop an
 *     already-due bill from the projection mid-month; it ages out once its due
 *     month passes),
 *   - a blended bill for the current OPEN cycle: actual booked+pending spend so
 *     far, plus the caller-supplied cycle forecast pro-rated over the days of
 *     the cycle still ahead — but only up to the forecast (once actuals reach
 *     the expected total, no extra estimate is piled on top),
 *   - the current outstanding + the month it's due (for the net-worth liability),
 *   - the "best day to shop" = the day after the statement closes (max float).
 *
 * Cycle spend counts PURCHASES net of merchant refunds, but NEVER card
 * payments/settlements (the credit that pays a prior statement). A payment
 * booked inside the current cycle would otherwise cancel that cycle's purchases
 * — it reduces the outstanding balance, it is not negative spend. See
 * `isCardPayment`.
