  Deploy Sampolio to PRODUCTION on this machine — rebuild the prod `.next-prod`
  build in place from the current working tree and restart the live `com.sampolio.app`
  launchd service (https://sampolio.example.com, port 3999).

  INVOKE ONLY when the user EXPLICITLY asks to deploy / release / publish / ship
  Sampolio to production (e.g. "/deploy-prod", "deploy to prod", "push this live",
  "release it"). This restarts the live service that serves real financial data.

  NEVER invoke this proactively or automatically — not after edits, not after tests
  pass, not as a follow-up to other work, not because a task "seems done". It runs
  only on a direct, unambiguous production-deploy request. That request is itself
  the authorization to restart the live service, so once invoked the skill runs end
  to end (build → gates → restart) without pausing to re-confirm.

# Deploy Sampolio to production

`https://sampolio.example.com` is a placeholder. Resolve the actual production
URL from the host configuration before running health checks.

This deploys the **current working tree** of `$HOME/sampolio` to the
live service running on this same machine: launchd agent `com.sampolio.app` runs
`next start -p 3999 -H 127.0.0.1` (loopback only) against the `.next-prod/` build and the real data at
`~/.sampolio/data`. Caddy reverse-proxies `https://sampolio.example.com` → it.

There is no separate prod checkout — **deploying = rebuild `.next-prod` in place,
then restart the launchd agent** so the new build is loaded. Prod keeps serving its
old in-memory build until that restart, so all checks run *before* it.

## Two absolute rules

1. **Explicit request only.** Run this skill only when the user directly asked to
   deploy to production. Do not infer it from "the feature is done" or "tests pass".
   Invoking the skill on that request **is** the authorization to restart prod.
2. **Gate on green, not on a prompt.** Build and run every gate first (none of these
   touch the running service). The `launchctl` restart is the point of no return —
   proceed to it automatically **only if lint + tests + build all passed**. Do NOT
   ask the user to confirm the restart (the deploy request already authorized it).
   If any gate fails, abort and leave prod on its old build.

## Preconditions to check first

- You are on this machine (macOS) with the repo at `$HOME/sampolio`.
- This is a **production** deploy from the working tree as-is. Surface any
  unfinished/experimental work in the tree in the step-1 report so it's visible —
  but don't pause for approval; the deploy request stands. Only stop if the tree
  contains something clearly catastrophic to ship (e.g. secrets, obviously broken
  code) that the gates wouldn't catch.

## Steps

Run `node`/`pnpm` under **nvm Node 26** — the system Node 22 is first on `PATH` and
must not be used. Prefix the build pipeline with:

```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 26
```

### 1. Show what's shipping
```sh
git -C $HOME/sampolio status --short
git -C $HOME/sampolio log -1 --oneline
```
Report the branch, last commit, and the uncommitted changes — this is exactly what
will go live (deploy tree as-is; do not commit or push).

### 2. Snapshot the production data (safety net)
First refresh the encrypted SQLite snapshot (skip if `~/.sampolio/data/sampolio.db`
does not exist yet — the first 4.x boot creates it). It is safe while the app runs:
```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 26 \
  && cd $HOME/sampolio && DATA_DIR="$HOME/.sampolio/data" node scripts/db-snapshot.mjs
```
Then take a timestamped tarball. It **excludes** the key/secret dot-files (a backup
must never carry the key that decrypts it) and the live SQLite files (a hot copy of
`sampolio.db` + `-wal`/`-shm` can be torn); `snapshots/sampolio.db` is the
consistent, still-encrypted copy that goes in instead:
```sh
tar -czf "$HOME/sampolio-data-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz" -C "$HOME/.sampolio" \
  --exclude='data/.encryption_key' --exclude='data/.auth_secret' --exclude='data/.auth_url' \
  --exclude='data/sampolio.db' --exclude='data/sampolio.db-wal' --exclude='data/sampolio.db-shm' \
  data
```
Confirm the tarball exists and report its path + size. (A daily backup already runs
at 05:10; this is extra insurance for the deploy. A code deploy does not touch data,
except that the first 4.x boot creates `sampolio.db` and imports the `.enc` users.)

### 3. Preflight + build into the prod dir

**First, check the PWA service-worker cache version.** Prod ships `public/sw.js`
(served as-is from `/public`). Its cache name is keyed by a `CACHE_VERSION` constant.
Hashed assets under `/_next/static/*` self-invalidate (new build → new filenames),
but stably-named cached assets do **not** — so if this deploy changes any of:
- `public/sw.js` itself (its caching logic / precache list), or
- a precached / stably-named cached asset: `public/offline.html`, `public/icons/*`,
  or `public/themes/*`,

then **bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `public/sw.js`** (e.g. `v1` → `v2`) so the new SW drops
the stale caches on `activate`. The step-1 `git status`/diff shows whether any of
these changed. If none changed, leave it as-is. (Skip this entirely if the repo has
no `public/sw.js` — the PWA isn't set up.)

Then run the pipeline — one chain that aborts on the first failure.
`NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-prod` is what makes the build land in the dir prod actually
serves (and keeps it isolated from the dev preview's `.next`):
```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 26 \
  && export NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-prod \
  && cd $HOME/sampolio \
  && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile \
  && pnpm lint \
  && pnpm test \
  && pnpm build
```
- **Any failure here aborts the deploy** — prod stays up on its old build. Report
  what failed; do not restart.
- If `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` fails with `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION`
  (pnpm 11 supply-chain embargo) or a lockfile/`package.json` mismatch: do **not**
  force it. Regenerate the lockfile under Node 26
  (`pnpm install --lockfile-only [--config.minimumReleaseAge=0]`), re-run, and only
  then continue.
- Confirm `.next-prod/BUILD_ID` was (re)written: `ls -l $HOME/sampolio/.next-prod/BUILD_ID`.
- The dev preview (port 4999, `next dev`) may keep running — it writes `.next`,
  prod uses `.next-prod`; they don't collide.

### 4. Pre-restart summary (no confirmation prompt)
Report — don't ask: branch/commit being shipped, that lint+tests+build passed, and
the snapshot path. Then proceed straight to step 5. **Do not** call `AskUserQuestion`
here; the deploy request already authorized the restart. The only thing that blocks
step 5 is a **failed gate** in step 3 — if everything passed, continue automatically.

### 5. Restart production
```sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.sampolio.app
```
If that errors or the job is parked in launchd's penalty box (repeated prior
failures), do a full reload:
```sh
launchctl bootout   gui/$(id -u)/com.sampolio.app 2>/dev/null
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sampolio.app.plist"
```

### 6. Verify health
Do **not** use `sleep` (the Bash tool blocks foreground sleep). Poll with curl retry,
which also waits out the Next.js boot:
```sh
# Readiness (waits for the new process to come up): expect 307 (-> /auth/signin) or 200
curl -sS --retry 15 --retry-delay 1 --retry-all-errors -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:3999/

# Service health: 2nd column is the last exit code; 0 = healthy
launchctl list | grep com.sampolio.app

# Listening on 3999, loopback only: expect 127.0.0.1:3999 (a *:3999 line means
# the plist still binds every interface)
lsof -nP -iTCP:3999 -sTCP:LISTEN

# End-to-end through Caddy: 307 is the healthy unauthenticated response
curl -skI https://sampolio.example.com/ | head -1

# Fresh startup errors
tail -n 30 "$HOME/.sampolio/logs/sampolio-error.log"

# DB boot lines: "[db] opened encrypted database …", on the first 4.x boot
# "[db] imported N legacy users (M soft-deleted) …", then "[db] snapshot (startup) written …"
grep -h '\[db\]' "$HOME/.sampolio/logs/"*.log | tail -n 5
```
Then refresh the snapshot so the post-deploy state is captured:
```sh
cd $HOME/sampolio && DATA_DIR="$HOME/.sampolio/data" node scripts/db-snapshot.mjs
```

### 7. Report
- **Success:** state it's live and healthy, the commit/branch deployed, the HTTP
  codes seen (local + Caddy), and the snapshot path.
- **Failure:** show the `sampolio-error.log` tail and give rollback guidance — do
  **not** auto-rollback (git state is the user's call):
  ```sh
  # Revert the working tree to the last known-good state, then rebuild + restart:
  git -C $HOME/sampolio stash        # or: git checkout <prev-commit>
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 26 \
    && NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-prod pnpm -C $HOME/sampolio build
  launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.sampolio.app
  ```
  The step-2 snapshot is the data restore point if data ever needs it.

## Do NOT

- **Do not run `./scripts/install-launchd.sh` as part of a normal deploy.** It
  re-bakes the plist and, if `~/sampolio/.env` is ever missing, silently substitutes
  a *stale* `~/.sampolio/data/.encryption_key`, permanently orphaning all encrypted
  data. It's only for **Node-version changes** (re-baking the node path) or the
  one-time `NEXT_DIST_DIR` setup.
- **Do not write to `~/.sampolio/data`** except the tar snapshot and
  `scripts/db-snapshot.mjs` (which only rewrites `snapshots/sampolio.db`).
- **Do not build without `NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-prod`** — that would write `.next`
  (the dev dir), and the restart would serve a stale build.
- **Do not point a dev server at port 3999 or at `~/.sampolio/data`.** Dev runs on
  4999 against `./data` (see `.claude/launch.json`).
