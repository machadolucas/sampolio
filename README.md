# Sampolio - Personal Finance Planner

A self-hosted personal finance planning tool that replaces budgeting spreadsheets with a powerful, private workflow. Track multiple accounts, project your financial future, manage debts and investments, and reconcile balances — all stored locally with AES-256-GCM encryption.

## Features

### Cash Flow Management
- **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple financial accounts independently with different currencies (EUR, USD, BRL, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, SEK, NOK, DKK)
- **Recurring Income & Expenses**: Track fixed items (salary, rent, subscriptions) with monthly, quarterly, yearly, or custom interval frequencies
- **Planned Items**: One-off expenses (taxes, annual fees) and repeating non-monthly items (quarterly payments)
- **Occurrence Overrides**: Edit or skip individual occurrences of recurring items without changing the series
- **Salary Calculator**: Net salary computation with gross salary, taxable/non-taxable benefits, tax rate, contributions, and deductions — automatically linked to recurring income
- **Taxed Income**: Handle bonuses, holiday pay, and other special income with tax withholding (using salary settings or custom rates)
- **Category Management**: Built-in categories (Salary, Housing, Utilities, etc.) plus custom categories; remove or restore defaults

### Wealth Management
- **Investments**: Track investment accounts with starting valuations, annual growth rates, and one-off or recurring contributions/withdrawals
- **Debts**: Manage amortized loans (mortgages with fixed/variable interest, reference rates like Euribor) and fixed-installment debts (no interest). Track extra payments and remaining installments
- **Receivables**: Track money owed to you with optional interest rates, expected monthly repayments, and repayment recording

### Shared Mortgage
- **Co-Owned Mortgage Tracking**: Model a household mortgage shared between members (e.g. a couple), with multiple sub-loans, per-loan margins, and Euribor reference rates
- **Auto-Amortization Engine**: Monthly amortization on an actual/360 day count, re-annuitizing the payment at each rate reset to hold the maturity date
- **Ownership & Equity**: Derives each member's stake, liability, and equity from the down payments and house price; equity folds into net worth (no double counting as a debt)
- **Exact Reconciliation**: Reconcile each month from the bank's real figures (or bulk-import history via CSV), so the ledger matches the bank exactly; forecasts carry the current installment forward until the next rate reset
- **Euribor Reminder**: The Overview page flags when a mortgage's yearly Euribor rate is due for an update
- **Cashflow Integration**: Each member can link the mortgage to their own cash account so their share of the monthly charge appears as a read-only line in their projection

### Budgets
- **Trip/Project Budgets**: Plan a bounded-period budget (e.g. a research stay abroad) with one-off and monthly cost lines
- **Grant Funding**: Add funding sources — grants (optionally restricted to specific categories), per-diem allowances, and other income — with automatic allocation and a feasibility verdict (out-of-pocket, surplus)
- **Expense Log**: Record dated actual expenses and track them against the plan
- **CSV Export**: Export a grant report (spending log + summary) as a fi-FI Excel-friendly CSV
- **Cashflow Integration**: A confirmed budget linked to a cash account injects its monthly impact into that account's projection (with manual exchange rate for cross-currency budgets)

### Financial Projections
- **Multi-Year Cash Flow Projections**: See your financial future up to 10 years ahead with instant recalculation across all accounts
- **Net Worth Projection**: Aggregate wealth over time combining cash accounts, investments, receivables, and debts
- **Debt Amortization Schedules**: Automatic calculation with support for variable interest rates and rate reset frequencies
- **Investment Growth Modeling**: Compound monthly growth based on annual rates, incorporating contributions and withdrawals
- **"What If?" Playground**: Explore hypothetical changes (a raise, a new expense, a cancelled subscription, extra savings) and instantly compare the projected balance against your current plan — scenarios are computed on the fly and never saved

### Reconciliation
- **Monthly Balance Verification**: Compare projected vs. actual balances for all entity types (cash, investments, receivables, debts)
- **Variance Tracking**: Calculate and display differences between expected and actual balances
- **Adjustment Categories**: Classify variances as untracked income/expense, valuation change, interest adjustment, data correction, or other
- **Session Management**: Track reconciliation sessions with in-progress and completed states

### Data Visualization
- **Sankey Flow Chart**: Visualize how income flows through the budget to expenses each month
- **Waterfall Chart**: Balance progression month-by-month showing how each month's net change builds on the previous
- **Treemap Chart**: Expense proportions by category and individual items
- **Net Worth Line Chart**: Track net worth trend over time
- **Wealth Composition Chart**: Stacked breakdown of assets over time (cash, investments, receivables, liabilities)
- **Mortgage Ownership Sankey**: Visualize how each monthly mortgage charge splits into interest, principal, fees, and ownership equity

### User Experience
- **Onboarding Wizard**: Guided 5-step setup for first-time users (account, income, expenses)
- **Command Palette**: Quick access to any action via keyboard (Cmd+K)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Cmd+I (add income), Cmd+E (add expense), Cmd+M (monthly check-in / reconcile)
- **Dark/Light Theme**: System-wide theme toggle with PrimeReact dark theme integration
- **Interactive Month Navigation**: Scrollable month strip for quick date navigation in cashflow view
- **Data Maintenance**: Prune accumulated reconciliation snapshots/sessions from Settings → Data & storage (preview then compact); projections stay byte-identical and mortgage data is never touched

### Administration
- **User Management**: Admin panel for creating, updating, and deactivating users
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and user roles with first-user-becomes-admin logic
- **Self-Signup Control**: Admins can enable/disable public registration
- **Cache Management**: Force revalidation of all caches from settings

### Security & Privacy
- **File-Based Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation — your data stays on your server
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing (12 rounds), strong password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars)
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after 10 failed attempts within 15 minutes
- **Rate Limiting**: Edge middleware caps unauthenticated auth requests (20/min) and general requests (300/min) per IP
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, frame options, CSP, HSTS, restricted permissions policy
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy by cloning and building on your own server — no external database needed

## Architecture

### Server Actions (No REST API)

The application uses Next.js Server Actions exclusively for all backend operations — there are no traditional REST API routes (except the NextAuth handler at `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`). All server actions are located in `src/lib/actions/` and follow a consistent pattern:

- `'use server'` directive at the top
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Authentication check via `auth()`
- Return type: `ApiResponse<T>` (`{ success: boolean; data?: T; error?: string }`)
- Cache invalidation via `updateTag()` after mutations

### File-Based Encrypted Database

All data is stored as individually encrypted JSON files in `~/.sampolio/data/` (configurable):

```
~/.sampolio/data/
├── users-index.enc              # User ID/email lookup
├── app-settings.enc             # Global settings (self-signup, etc.)

```

> **Note**: A mortgage is the one entity shared by multiple users, so it lives under `shared/` rather than under a single user. Access control is enforced in the action layer by checking the requester against the mortgage's member list.

**Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations). Each file has its own random salt and IV. Derived keys are cached in an LRU cache (max 500 entries) to avoid repeated PBKDF2 computation.

### Caching Strategy

- Next.js `cacheLife('indefinite')` for data queries (1-year stale/revalidate/expire)
- Granular cache tags per entity type: `user:{userId}:accounts`, `user:{userId}:debts`, etc.
- Cache invalidation via `updateTag()` after any mutation in server actions
- Admin can force-revalidate all caches from settings

### Projection Engine

**Cash Flow Projection** (`src/lib/projection.ts`):
1. Starts with each account's starting balance at its starting date
2. Iterates month-by-month through the planning horizon
3. For each month: applies recurring items (checking frequency/dates), one-off planned items, and occurrence overrides
4. Rolls up monthly data into yearly summaries

**Wealth Projection** (`src/lib/wealth-projection.ts`):
Aggregates across all entity types for each month:
- Cash accounts: balance from cashflow projection
- Investments: compound monthly growth + contributions - withdrawals
- Receivables: principal - repayments + interest accrual
- Debts: amortization schedule with interest (fixed or variable rates)
- Net worth: cash + investments + receivables - debts

## Production Deployment

The app is deployed by cloning this repository on the server and building it
**in place** with `./scripts/server-deploy.sh`. There is no separate packaging
step — `next start` serves the production build from the installed
`node_modules`, which avoids the standalone-bundle dependency-tracing issues that
broke the old zip-based packaging.

### Deploying on a server (git clone)

**Prerequisites on the server**: `git`, `pnpm`, and a Node.js version manager
(`fnm` or `nvm`) so the version pinned in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) can be installed.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/machadolucas/sampolio.git ~/sampolio
cd ~/sampolio
```

**2. Install dependencies and build:**
```bash
./scripts/server-deploy.sh
```
This activates the Node version from `.nvmrc` (installing it via fnm/nvm if
needed), runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, and builds the app. It **refuses
to continue on the wrong Node major version**, so a mismatched server Node can't
silently produce a broken build.

**3a. Run manually (foreground):**
```bash
./scripts/run-sampolio.sh
```

**3b. Or install as an auto-starting service (recommended):**
```bash
./scripts/install-launchd.sh
```
The app starts automatically on login and restarts if it crashes. The resolved
Node binary path (matching `.nvmrc`) is baked into the launchd plist at install
time, so it doesn't depend on an interactive shell at boot.

#### Environment Variables on Deployment

**Recommended: Using .env File** (ensures secrets stay consistent)

The repo includes a `.env.example` template. Create your `.env` file at the repo root with fixed secrets:

```bash
# In the cloned repo (~/sampolio)
cp .env.example .env

# Generate your secrets
echo "AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
echo "ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env

# Edit .env to verify values
nano .env
```

Then run normally:
```bash
./scripts/run-sampolio.sh  # or ./scripts/install-launchd.sh
```

**Important**:
- Keep your `.env` file secure and backed up
- Never change `ENCRYPTION_KEY` — existing data will be unreadable
- Never commit `.env` to version control

**Alternative: Auto-Generated Secrets**

If you don't provide a `.env` file, secrets are auto-generated on first run:
- `AUTH_SECRET`: Stored in `~/.sampolio/data/.auth_secret`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Stored in `~/.sampolio/data/.encryption_key`

**Optional Environment Variables** (in .env or as exports):
```bash
SAMPOLIO_PORT=3999                    # Server port (default: 3999)
SAMPOLIO_HOST=0.0.0.0                # Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
SAMPOLIO_DATA_DIR=~/.sampolio/data   # Data directory
```

**Migrating Data Between Servers**:

**Important**: Use the same `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to decrypt existing data.

**Method 1: Copy .env file and data** (simplest):
```bash
# On source server, backup everything
tar -czf sampolio-backup.tar.gz -C ~/sampolio .env -C ~/.sampolio data

# Transfer to new server (clone the repo there first, then:)
scp sampolio-backup.tar.gz new-server:~/

# On new server, extract into the clone
cd ~/sampolio
tar -xzf ~/sampolio-backup.tar.gz

# The .env file from source server is now in place
./scripts/server-deploy.sh && ./scripts/run-sampolio.sh
```

**Method 2: Using auto-generated secrets**:
```bash
# On source server, backup secrets and data
tar -czf sampolio-backup.tar.gz -C ~/.sampolio data

# Transfer to new server
scp sampolio-backup.tar.gz new-server:~/

# On new server, extract before first run
cd ~
mkdir -p .sampolio
tar -xzf sampolio-backup.tar.gz -C .sampolio

# Build, then run - will use existing .auth_secret and .encryption_key files
cd ~/sampolio
./scripts/server-deploy.sh && ./scripts/run-sampolio.sh
```

#### Upgrading to a New Version

On the server, pull the latest code and rebuild in place:

```bash
cd ~/sampolio

# (Optional) back up your data before a major upgrade
tar -czf ~/sampolio-data-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C ~/.sampolio data

# Pull + install + build in one step
./scripts/server-deploy.sh --pull

# Reload the service to pick up the new build
./scripts/install-launchd.sh   # re-running it reloads the launchd agent
```

If you run manually instead of via launchd, stop with `Ctrl+C` and start again
with `./scripts/run-sampolio.sh`.

Verify:
```bash
tail -f ~/.sampolio/logs/sampolio.log   # if using launchd
open http://localhost:3999
```

**Notes**:
- Your data in `~/.sampolio/data/` and your `.env` are untouched by upgrades.
- `--pull` runs `git pull --ff-only`; commit or stash local changes first.
- If `.nvmrc` changed, `server-deploy.sh` installs/activates the new Node version
  automatically (via fnm/nvm).
- To roll back: `git checkout <previous-tag-or-commit>` then
  `./scripts/server-deploy.sh`.

#### Uninstalling Auto-Start

```bash
./scripts/uninstall-launchd.sh
```

### Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use the Node version pinned in .nvmrc (26)
FROM node:26-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
# Node 25+ no longer bundles corepack — install pnpm directly
RUN npm i -g pnpm
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM node:26-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV DATA_DIR=/app/data
# Copy the built app together with its node_modules and run via `next start`
COPY --from=builder /app ./

EXPOSE 3999
CMD ["node", "node_modules/next/dist/bin/next", "start", "-p", "3999", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t sampolio .

# Option 1: Using .env file (recommended)
docker run -p 3999:3999 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data --env-file .env sampolio

# Option 2: Explicit environment variables
docker run -p 3999:3999 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=your-secret \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-key \
  sampolio
```
